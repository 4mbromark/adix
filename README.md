# Adix

Adix was an ambitious project for a portal that had to manage all the accounting and data of an accounting firm. The fundamental point of this application was security and rigorous permission management, which was absolutely necessary. The project was abandoned due to the loss of interest on the part of the commissioner, who is continuing to use Excel as a database.
